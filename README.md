# BoardGameGeekTools
A few functions I wrote to access board game data from boardgamegeek.com using the xml API https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2

## Use
These tools can be used to automatically populate a database with information about your boardgames. It pulls id, rating, complexity and the min and max playtimes and player counts for games.
There is a function to take in a csv file with the first row as board games and then return a list of the data for all games.
